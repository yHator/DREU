I have met with Dr. Glencora Borradaile last week to go over the expectations for this project and the rest of their team. I will be working with a graduate student, N, on a project researching the Chilling Effect. This week, I have begun to familiarize myself with the topic of the Chilling Effect by reading papers and engaging in discourse with the team. I am also exploring some of the Twitter API capabilities in preparation for gathering data. I am also using Zotero, a software that easily collects papers and makes references for them. On the topic of new technologies, I am now using Signal and Keybase that offer end-to-end encrypted communication. 

I’m really excited to work on this research project, I think it is a great opportunity to learn about the roles that laws and regulation can play in cybersecurity and privacy.
