It is my last week of DREU research! I truly have had a great experience and I have learned a lot about what my interests are. I have had not great experiences before, and I've learned that the people I work with truly are what makes me feel happy and able to work hard. I really enjoyed working with Dr. Cora, N, A, and B. I feel proud of the work I was able to complete this summer, and despite the online format of this research program, it was still a lot of fun.

I left off with creating graphs and visualizations as well as some issues with the data, but all have been documented and reported to the group. Dr. Cora mentioned hiring an undergraduate student to continue with this work now that it is well-defined. I feel immensely proud that my work has had a meaningful impact. Thank you to Dr. Cora, N, A, and B, as well as the DREU for funding this research.
