This week I am continuing with the spreadsheet mapping. N and I are getting to potential project proposals and are now doing research on ways to test the Chilling Effect. Maybe we don't have the resources to do the project ourselves, but perhaps it could serve as a starting point for others. Overall, I really really enjoy what I am learning! My project is very different from other people's (there is a research group meeting through OSU that I am attending) research, but I think this topic is unique and really aligns with my own interests. During our meeting I realized how much I learned. I had been struggling to grasp the different concepts and contexts of Chilling Effects, but when I did a presentation on it, I felt confident in what I know. I'm excited to see where this research goes.

One idea that I have been thinking about is researching the chilling effect from a law perspective. That is, closely analyzing cases that have some relation to the chilling effect, in order to get ideas for projects that we can work on.
