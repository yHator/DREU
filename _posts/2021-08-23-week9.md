title: Week 9, 08/23/21 - 08/29/21

We pulled a lot of data from Twitter. I'm not sure if I will be able to finish analysis by the end of next week, but we used up the monthly limit, which is great! No data was wasted. I have also been working on coming up with other avenues of research related to the chilling effect, and documenting those. Those notes along with some code that I have written for them will be available to N. This week, instead of reading a weekly paper, we attended a (virtual) talk called "City of Portland Digital Services: Open data, privacy, and surveillance technologies" by Hector Dominguez. I am not a local resident of Portland, so I did not have prior knowledge of its digital services and thus this presentation was very interesting to me! I learned about city-wide data collection, costs, and different projects that people are working on in order to make people's way of life seamless. There is a lot of processes that are hidden away and simplified, like traffic.
