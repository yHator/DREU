N and I have made a lot of progress in planning our research. As usual, I am surprised by how much we don't know. Every time we think we have a good idea, there's a new angle to approach our problem, our an idea that's way more convoluted and difficult than we expected. Normally I would be frustrated by roadblocks, but I'm weirdly exhilirated. Even though sometimes I think, I wish I had thought about reading case law and understanding it sooner, I'm still excited about the fact that I know to think about it at all. I'm so excited about what I get to learn!

N and I went over our project proposal with A, a fifth year graduate student. There were a lot of aspects of the project that we didn't consider, like funding. I haven't worked on such a complex project before and we need access to multiple API's in order to gather the necessary data. I tried using the free version but unfortunately it does not encompass the kind of data I need (meaning we need the paid version). A said that perhaps after N and I speak with our advisor, we may need to submit a project proposal to receive funding.
