N and I went over our project proposal with A, a fifth year graduate student. There were a lot of aspects of the project that we didn't consider, like funding. I haven't worked on such a complex project before and we need access to multiple API's in order to gather the necessary data. I tried using the free version but unfortunately it does not encompass the kind of data I need (meaning we need the paid version). A said that perhaps after N and I speak with our advisor, we may need to submit a project proposal to receive funding.
