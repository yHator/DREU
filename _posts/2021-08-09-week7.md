I am still working on the Twitter script, but I did expect it to take awhile since it is a major contribution to our research discovery. Meanwhile, I am planning to present a poster at the GHC21 conference for this project. At first I was worried that I do not have much to show for results, but I think just educating people on chilling effects is important. I feel really happy with what I have learned and how it has expanded my understanding of the intersection of law and technology.
