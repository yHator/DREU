N and I have made a lot of progress in planning our research. As usual, I am surprised by how much we don't know. Every time we think we have a good idea, there's a new angle to approach our problem, our an idea that's way more convoluted and difficult than we expected. Normally I would be frustrated by roadblocks, but I'm weirdly exhilirated. Even though sometimes I think, I wish I had thought about reading case law and understanding it sooner, I'm still excited about the fact that I know to think about it at all. I'm so excited about what I get to learn!
