We are finally at the data collection stage! Dr. Cora seems to think our plan is good, now all we need to do is start gathering some evidence of a Chilling Effect. Then we can use that data to support an application for a grant. I am currently working on a Twitter script and N is looking into Tor data research. Dr. Cora had us spend a lot of time doing research to understand the Chilling Effect and I think it has paid off in a robust project design.
