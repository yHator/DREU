I am working on creating a mapping of Jonathon W. Penney's "Understanding Chilling Effects" with the graduate student, N. The more we discuss and read literature related to the Chilling Effect, the more complex our mapping becomes, but I think it also really helps to clarify the new topics that Penney has introduced in this paper as opposed to the last paper we were relying on, "Chilling Effects: Online surveillance and Wikipedia." There are many types of Chilling Effects, but I hope we get to focus on either the social media, surveillance, or legal chilling. We also have been delving into legal papers which are difficult to read.
